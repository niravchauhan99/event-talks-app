## ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 **Real-Time Synchronisation**: Fetch live updates directly from the official Google Cloud BigQuery Release Notes feed.
- 🧩 **Granular Update Parsing**: Splits aggregated daily release notes into separate cards classified by type (e.g., *Feature*, *Changed*, *Deprecated*, *Resolved*).
- 🔍 **Fuzzy Live Search**: Instant search matching date, type, or description keywords without reloading the page.
- 🏷️ **Dynamic Category Filtering**: Filter release notes using active status badges which show numerical update counts dynamically.
- 🐦 **Custom Tweet Composer**: Select any release note update to prefill a custom composition modal. Features a dynamic 280-character limit tracker and progress bar before launching Twitter/X Web Intent.
- ⚡ **Caching Layer**: Built-in 5-minute in-memory caching to avoid feed throttling and improve speed.
- 🔔 **Toast Notification Engine**: Animated status updates (success, error, information alerts) in the viewport.
